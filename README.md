## Ticketing
For ticketing and allocation of work, we followed an agile methodology. We created tickets in Trello with six basic states: 
- Important Reference Info - Planning and universal information that is commonly referenced
- Back Burner - work that will be tackled in future sprints
- Sprint Plan - work that will be finished in current sprint
- In Progress NOW - what is currently being worked on by each member of the team this sprint
- Staged for merge - complete, but work waiting to be reviewed and merged
- Deployed to production - work has been added to current deployment
